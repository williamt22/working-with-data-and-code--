Welcome to Page Play! 
This is my Working With Data and Code A2 - Code Prototype Project 

An interactive text-based adventure game where you find yourself stranded in the woods unsure of how you ended up there...
The game starts with an introduction, pressing A is not neccessary until you see a screen telling you your adventure awaits! 
Afterwards you will follow dialogue leading to a set of choices, you can then choose between A or B.
Follow the game through multiple times to attempt each ending.

Thank you :)
